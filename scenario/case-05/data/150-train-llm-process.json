However, this does not include journal data. While using the Diarium Cloud Sync feature, user databases are uploaded to personal Cloud Storage, such as OneDrive or Google Drive, through official APIs. The third-party Cloud services have their own privacy policies. Services in the \"Feeds & Events\" section might be connected to augment your journal, and communication to those services is sent encrypted. No personal data is published on your behalf. Diarium accesses your daily step count and sleep data for display in journal entries but does not share this health data with others.\nData Collect:\nDiarium collects information during its download and usage such as device's IP address, the Application pages visited, the time and date of visits, time spent on these pages and the operating system used on the device. User data is processed upon consent to this privacy policy, and all data collection ceases when the Application is uninstalled. The application uses Firebase, Sentry, and Mixpanel to monitor app usage, identify bugs, and rectify crashes. Default settings store the journal database on the device, but Diarium Cloud Sync can be chosen to synchronize data across devices. The \"Feeds & Events\" section is used to enrich your journal data, accessed through official APIs and SSL. Google Fit is used to access daily step count and sleep data when enabled in the app settings. They do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 deliberately. "
