These numbers are transmitted to a third-party server for telecommunications operator verification. Additionally, during activated communication functions for incoming and outgoing calls, the phone numbers are shared with a third-party server. Lastly, the application includes \"AdMob\" ads, which might need user's app usage data, managed by ad networks, to provide relevant advertisements. OSHEMB bears no responsibility for data processing from third-party servers or cookies that are added by ad networks.\nData Collect:\nGenerally, OSHEMB avoids personal data collection from app users. However, the application collects phone numbers from user contacts and call logs for the purpose of inserting them into the designated fields. This information is then sent to a third-party server to check operator affiliation. Also, when communication functions are activated, during each call, these numbers are collected to identify the telecom operator. Additionally, usage data for the application is required by \"AdMob\" ads to advertise relevant products and services. All personal information use is subject to user consent. However, OSHEMB does not collect or store any personal information such as email or name, and remains unaccountable for information collection by advertisers and shown adverts. "

This biometric data is encrypted with the UIDAI public key certificate and can only be decrypted by the UIDAI itself. No intermediate or third party can utilize this data. When initiating a call to RD service for capturing biometric data from a third-party application, the user must make sure the third-party application collects explicit user consent before capturing biometric data.\nData Collect:\nDespite RD-Service not collecting user data on the developer's server, Google, using the SafetyNet API, may enable the collection of data on its server, which is separate from the developer's server. RD service does collect certain data as required by UIDAI guidelines. This includes the device's IP address, IMEI number, and other handset details solely for tracing purposes. These data are utilized for no other purpose. Biometric data capture using the biometric scanner for Aadhaar authentication is encrypted and converted into a secure format. It is noteworthy that this biometric data is encrypted and is not accessible to any third party or intermediary. The third-party application which initiates data collection from RD service is responsible for gaining explicit user consent. "

However, this does not include journal data. While using the Diarium Cloud Sync feature, user databases are uploaded to personal Cloud Storage, such as OneDrive or Google Drive, through official APIs. The third-party Cloud services have their own privacy policies. Services in the \"Feeds & Events\" section might be connected to augment your journal, and communication to those services is sent encrypted. No personal data is published on your behalf. Diarium accesses your daily step count and sleep data for display in journal entries but does not share this health data with others.\nData Collect:\nDiarium collects information during its download and usage such as device's IP address, the Application pages visited, the time and date of visits, time spent on these pages and the operating system used on the device. User data is processed upon consent to this privacy policy, and all data collection ceases when the Application is uninstalled. The application uses Firebase, Sentry, and Mixpanel to monitor app usage, identify bugs, and rectify crashes. Default settings store the journal database on the device, but Diarium Cloud Sync can be chosen to synchronize data across devices. The \"Feeds & Events\" section is used to enrich your journal data, accessed through official APIs and SSL. Google Fit is used to access daily step count and sleep data when enabled in the app settings. They do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 deliberately. "
