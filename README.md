# <a name="1"></a> Unveiling Discrepancies in Android App Data Safety Declarations and Privacy Policies: An In-depth Analysis using Large Language Models

## Abstract

This paper investigates the critical inconsistencies observed between data safety declarations and privacy policies on the Android platform, highlighting prevalent ‘incomplete’ and ‘incorrect’ issues. Such misalignments undermine user trust and pose substantial ethical and legal challenges. Our research represents a pioneering effort in this field, raising essential questions about the potential of an approach to address these disparities. We specifically explore whether advanced techniques—namely, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) such as Gemini 1.5, ChatGPT 3.5, 4, and 4o—could supplant the role of experts. Furthermore, we expand different labeling strategies by LLMs during training to assess whether this increases accuracy and to examine potential hallucination issues that may impact the classification. To this end, we implement four scenarios across eight cases: i) zero-shot by ChatGPT 3.5; ii) manual label fine-tuning by ChatGPT 3.5; iii) fine-tuning with 150 apps using labels generated by ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, and Gemini 1.5; and iv) fine-tuning with 450 apps using labels from these platforms. Our findings indicate that while the zero-shot LLM scenario showed variable accuracy (ranging from 57% to 79%), manual label fine-tuning yielded promising results with accuracies between 84% and 95%. Fine-tuning with LLM-generated labels for 150 apps resulted in accuracies ranging from 76% to 94% with the best outcome of Gemini 1.5. Notably, when scaling up to 450 apps, the accuracy remained stable for ChatGPT 4o and Gemini models. Still, it declined slightly from 76% to 73% for the ChatGPT 4 model for the ‘incorrect’ classification, likely due to hallucination effects caused by inadequate training data. Committed to transparency and advancing research in this domain, we release a benchmark dataset and maintain a list of the analyzed 600 Android apps.
